I think I get the concept but not fully
Example is a bit confusing
Can you explain that part again
I understood the first half
Second half lost me
Not very clear
Some parts make sense
Some parts don’t
What is step 3 doing
Step 3 again please
I’m partially following
I get the idea but the example is weird
Example doesn’t match theory
Can we do one more example
I’m okay but unsure
Still a little confused
Flow is hard to follow
Can you summarize once
I didn’t understand the diagram
Diagram slightly confusing
I know the topic but not the logic
Logic part again pls
Half understood
Not fully clear
I might get it after revision
Can you slow down a little
Better now but still unsure
I think I’m getting it
Almost clear
Need one final recap
